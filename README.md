To run back-end server u need - ```yarn dev-server``` you can start the server, before you need to install dependencies. </br>

Time was limited so what is ready: project boilerplate with typescript validation and koa as main library for back-end,
also finisshed validating data on request so it will reject half of invalid requests, back-end logic is half ready because of 
js async currently return Promise<pending> and catching bad responses also not ready, but as you can see pretty good basis is ready 
so I can easily finish it in additional hour.
